# [EN] Lab 8: Interaction between Power Automate and Power Apps

**Scenario:** you will create a PowerApps form that will allow any user to create a Team. The first part of the lab will just call a dummy Flow that you will create. If time permits, you will invoke the Team creation Flow that you will create later.
